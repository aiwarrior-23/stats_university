          Relative Frequency depicts that out of all the categories present, whats the proportion
          of observations in each category.
          Let us try to find out the relative frequency of the Pizza example.

          Total number of items sold = 175
          Relative Frequency of Pizza = 20/175 = 0.11
          Relative Frequency of Burger = 30/175 = 0.17
          Relative Frequency of Coffee = 25/175 = 0.14
          Relative Frequency of Water Bottles = 100/175 = 0.57
